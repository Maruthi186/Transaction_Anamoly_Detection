Anomaly Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for anomaly detection using machine learning techniques. The notebook demonstrates various methods for identifying anomalies in data, which can be useful in applications such as fraud detection, network security, and predictive maintenance.

Overview

Anomaly detection is a crucial aspect of data analysis that helps in identifying rare and unusual patterns that do not conform to expected behavior. These anomalies can indicate critical incidents, such as fraud in financial transactions, faults in industrial equipment, or cyber threats in a network. This project implements different machine learning techniques to detect anomalies in data effectively.

The notebook includes step-by-step explanations of data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. Various anomaly detection approaches, such as statistical methods, clustering-based techniques, and machine learning algorithms, are explored to provide a comprehensive understanding of the subject.
